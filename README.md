# Postman Collections for Learning

This repository is dedicated to practicing and improving my skills in **API testing with Postman**.  
It contains collections that cover both **basic** and **more advanced requests**, helping me to build confidence in working with different endpoints, parameters, authentication methods, and test scripts.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is:
- To support my personal growth as a tester and developer.  
- To provide a space for hands-on exercises with real and mock APIs.  
- To serve as a reference for future projects where API testing is required.  

âœ¨ This is a personal learning project, continuously evolving as I practice and experiment with new ideas in Postman.
